# Classification-of-Iris-Flower-Dataset-using-SVM
Classified Iris species with 98% precision using Support Vector Machines(SVM). Applied Train Test Split for splitting my data set into a training set and a testing set. and used GridSearchCV for getting more efficient parameter tuning. Also used libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for Data Visualization.
